# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner of the web 🌐. I'm passionate about building **lightweight**, **accessible** websites and apps, designed with **minimalism** and **digital well-being** in mind.

## What I do 🚀

- **Web Development**: Crafting simple, user-friendly websites that prioritize speed and usability.
- **App Development**: Building lightweight apps that don’t overload your device or your mind!
- **Accessibility First**: Ensuring everyone can easily navigate, regardless of ability 💡.
- **Digital Minimalism**: Keeping things clear, clean, and clutter-free ✨.

## About me 🌟

I'm **self-taught** and just getting started in this exciting world of web and app development. But here's a fun fact: when I'm not coding, I'm studying **Medicine** and **Nuclear Medicine Technology**! 🩺💻 So yeah, I'm all about balancing science, tech, and creativity!

## Why I do it 💡

The web can be a noisy place, but I believe in creating spaces that are simple, efficient, and enjoyable to use. Whether it's a website or an app, my focus is on **enhancing the user experience** without sacrificing speed or accessibility.


Thanks for stopping by! 🙌
